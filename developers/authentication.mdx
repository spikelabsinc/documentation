# Authentication

The Spike API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys from the [Spike Dashboard](https://dashboard.spike.dev).

## API Keys

Your API key carries privileges to access your organization's resources, so keep it secure. Don't share your API key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or public documentation.

All API requests must include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here
```

## Key types

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Live | `sk_live_` | Production keys with full access to your resources |
| Test | `sk_test_` | Sandbox keys for development and testing |

## Scopes

API keys can be scoped to limit their access:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `personalities:read` | Read personality configurations |
| `personalities:write` | Create and modify personalities |
| `users:read` | Read user data and memories |
| `users:write` | Create and modify users and memories |
| `conversations:read` | Read conversation history |
| `conversations:write` | Start and manage conversations |
| `*` | Full access to all resources |

## Example request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.spike.dev/v1/personalities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api.spike.dev/v1/personalities', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.spike.dev/v1/personalities',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Error responses

If authentication fails, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
  }
}
```

## Rate limits

API requests are rate limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests per minute |
|------|---------------------|
| Beta | 60 |
| Pro | 300 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error with a `Retry-After` header indicating when you can retry.

## Security best practices

<Warning>
Never expose your API key in client-side code. Always make API calls from your backend server.
</Warning>

- **Rotate keys regularly** — Generate new keys periodically and revoke old ones
- **Use scoped keys** — Create keys with only the permissions they need
- **Monitor usage** — Check your dashboard for unusual activity
- **Use environment variables** — Store keys in environment variables, not in code
