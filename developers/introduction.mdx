# Introduction

The Spike API lets you build AI companions that perceive, understand, and respond with genuine presence. Whether you're creating a voice assistant, video avatar, or text-based companion, Spike provides the infrastructure for natural, persistent relationships between users and AI.

## What you can build

- **Conversational AI** with personality, memory, and real-time voice/video
- **AI companions** that remember users across sessions and build genuine relationships
- **Interactive avatars** that see, hear, and respond with appropriate emotion
- **Knowledge-grounded assistants** that draw on your domain expertise
