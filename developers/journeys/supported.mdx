# Supported Journeys

Journeys span multiple categories and formats, from fixed-length programs to ongoing daily habits. Each journey type has specific characteristics that determine how users interact with them and how the AI companion adapts its behavior.

## Journey Categories

| Category | Description | Example Journeys |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `emotional` | Emotional growth, healing, self-discovery | "Heal Your Heart", "Anxiety Toolkit", "Grief Journey" |
| `fitness` | Health, exercise, physical wellness | "Couch to 5K", "30-Day Yoga", "Hydration Challenge" |
| `education` | Learning, skill-building, creative pursuits | "30 Day Writing Prompts", "Learn to Code", "Photography Basics" |
| `professional` | Career, productivity, professional development | "Level Up Your LinkedIn", "Interview Prep", "Public Speaking" |
| `fun` | Entertainment, personality quizzes, games | "Discover Your Hogwarts House", "What's Your Love Language?" |
| `habit` | Ongoing daily habits with no defined end | "Daily Gratitude", "Morning Routine", "Meditation Practice" |

### Filtering by Category

```bash
GET /marketplace/journeys?category=emotional
```

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "jrn_heal123",
      "title": "Heal Your Heart",
      "category": "emotional",
      "tagline": "A gentle journey through healing",
      "duration_display": "21 days",
      "companion_role": "Supportive Guide"
    },
    {
      "id": "jrn_anxiety456",
      "title": "Anxiety Toolkit",
      "category": "emotional",
      "tagline": "Build your personal calm",
      "duration_display": "14 days",
      "companion_role": "Supportive Guide"
    }
  ],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "cursor_abc"
}
```

## Duration Types

Journeys have different temporal structures based on their purpose:

| Type | Description | Streak Handling | Use Cases |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `fixed` | Set number of days/weeks (e.g., "30 days", "8 weeks") | Strict or forgiving based on config | Structured programs, courses |
| `variable` | Self-paced with defined end point | Flexible, no time pressure | Learning paths, skill-building |
| `ongoing` | Repeating habit with no end | Template steps repeat daily | Daily habits, routines |

### Fixed Duration

Fixed journeys have a set number of steps that must be completed within a timeframe:

```json
{
  "duration_type": "fixed",
  "duration_display": "30 days",
  "total_steps": 30,
  "frequency": "daily",
  "streak_sensitivity": "forgiving",
  "catch_up_days": 2
}
```

### Variable Duration

Variable journeys let users progress at their own pace:

```json
{
  "duration_type": "variable",
  "duration_display": "Self-paced",
  "total_steps": 12,
  "frequency": "at your pace",
  "streak_sensitivity": "flexible"
}
```

### Ongoing Duration

Ongoing journeys use template steps that repeat indefinitely:

```json
{
  "duration_type": "ongoing",
  "duration_display": "Ongoing",
  "total_steps": 1,
  "frequency": "daily",
  "streak_sensitivity": "forgiving"
}
```

For ongoing journeys, a single template step generates new instances each day.

## Companion Roles

The AI companion adapts its persona and communication style based on the journey type. Each journey defines a companion role that shapes how the AI responds:

| Role | Tone | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| Supportive Guide | Warm, validating, gentle | Emotional journeys, healing, vulnerability |
| Accountability Coach | Motivating, direct, encouraging | Fitness, habit-building, goals |
| Creative Cheerleader | Encouraging, playful, enthusiastic | Creative journeys, writing, art |
| Teacher | Instructive, structured, patient | Educational content, skill-building |
| Entertainer | Theatrical, fun, witty | Entertainment, quizzes, games |

### Role Behavior Examples

**Supportive Guide** (Emotional Journey)
> "Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to explore these feelings. What you wrote shows real self-awareness, and I'm honored you trusted me with it."

**Accountability Coach** (Fitness Journey)
> "Day 5 complete! You're building serious momentum here. Remember, consistency beats perfection. Ready to crush tomorrow?"

**Creative Cheerleader** (Writing Journey)
> "Oh wow, that opening line gave me chills! The way you described the light through the window—I could picture it perfectly. You're really finding your voice!"

**Teacher** (Education Journey)
> "Great work on that exercise! You've got the core concept down. One small tip: try adding a return type to make your function more explicit. Ready for the next challenge?"

**Entertainer** (Fun Journey)
> "A Ravenclaw answer! I should have known from your thoughtful approach. But wait—the Sorting Hat sees something else too... Let's dig deeper!"

### Setting Companion Roles

When creating a journey, specify the companion role:

```bash

```

```json
{
  "title": "30 Days of Creative Writing",
  "category": "education",
  "companion_role": "Creative Cheerleader",
  "companion_character": null
}
```

For role-playing journeys, you can also set a character:

```json

  "title": "Hogwarts Sorting Ceremony",
  "category": "fun",
  "companion_role": "Entertainer",

}
```

## Pricing Types

When a user starts a paid journey, their currency is validated:
